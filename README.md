# MSDS-422---Practical-Machine-Learning

From course syllabus: 
Course Description
The course introduces machine learning with business applications. It provides a survey of statistical and
machine learning algorithms and techniques including the machine learning framework, regression,
classification, regularization and reduction, tree-based methods, unsupervised learning, and fully connected,
convolutional, and recurrent neural networks. Students implement machine learning models with open-source
software for data science. They explore data and learn from data, finding underlying patterns useful for data
reduction, feature analysis, prediction, and classification.
